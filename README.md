# idrac-client
Scripts for running iDrac 6 client from console without accessing web and without WebStart

## Requirements
java, wget, unzip

## Install
We only need to download jar files from your server (replace 10.1.10.200 with your iDrac address):
```
./download.sh 10.1.10.200
```

## Running
```
./run.sh 10.1.10.200
```
If you need something special, edit scripts directly.
